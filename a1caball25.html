      <p>An important person in the history of computing is Max Mathews. He studied electrical engineering at Cal Tech and MIT. He was a pioneer in digital music production. He created the first fully developed music synthesis system for interactive compostion and realtime performances using minicomputers. <br>Both Mathews's and I share a love of music. I have played piano and trumpet for over 10 years. I frequently rely on audio producing software like iReal Pro when I want to practice with a computer generated band. It creates a computer generated drum set, piano, bass, guitar, and other aux. percussion that play the backing track to any song, so that I can play the melody and improvise over the chords. This very useful app would not have been possible without the innovation of Max Mathews.<br><img src="images/Mathews picture.png" style="width:250px;" alt="Picture of Max Mathews" id="img1" onclick="changeImage()"><br>This picture is clickable!
