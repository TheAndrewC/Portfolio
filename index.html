  <h3 id="about me">Hello, my name is Andrew Caballero</h3>
  <p>I attend the University of California, San Diego. I am majoring in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Design and Interaction. I am also minoring in Design.</p>
  <p>I am passionate about User Experience (UX) design, and hope to enter that field upon graduation. I enjoy being able to make things more user friendly and accessable. Also this field uses a conglomeration of creative and technical skills, which are both things I love.</p>
  <p>In my free time I love to play music. I have played trumpet for 9 years and currently play in the UCSD jazz ensemble. I also play piano, and have been learning great classical and jazz pieces. Besides music, I also love sports and frequently play soccer, ping pong, and baseball.</p>

        <p>I chose to create a Harry Potter scene involving a doe patronus, which is energy that takes the form of an animal and wards off despair. From this project I learned a lot about blending multiple images together. The lake, two large trees, and doe were all separate images when I started. </p>

      For this assignment, I had to weigh each score by their point value and percent of grade. I learned about using different types of averages. I also learned about using the IF function in Excel and used it to determine if each student passed (P) or didn't pass (NP). Excel is one of the best ways to deal with and organize large data sets.

    <img class="img-fluid" src="Final Images/Excel 2.png" alt="Excel spreadsheet and chart" width="100%">
      <p>
        Here, I used Excel to sort all the data from two different classes from highest to lowest scores. I also used nested IF functions do assign A, B, C, D, or F grades based off their final score and the grading rubric. Additionally, I learned how to create a graph to visually represent the distribution of scores and a chart to immediately see the distribution of scores.

                    In this assignment, I was tasked with using my knowledge of html, CSS, and Javascript. I created these interactive buttons that will increase or decrease the counter. Furthermore, I made it so it can't go below zero, and if you try to it will give you an error message. I also created a clickable image that changes the image displayed. Also when you click "Display message" it will ask for your name and will print a custom statement.

  <h3 id="communication">How I'm Staying in Touch</h3>
    <p>In the midst of the Covid-19 global health pandemic, we were all essencially forced to move back home and are isolated from friends and extended family. While this situation also can be lonely, I have found many ways to keep in touch with my family, friends and school groupd.</p>
    <p>Obviously, all of our classes are over Zoom; however, besides using them for classes, I have also used it to most game nights for my friends. Apps like Facetime are great, but are Apple-device exclusive. By using Zoom and free, third-party games like scribble.io or spyfall, I have been able to host large get-togethers with my friends and family. Additionally, there are extensions that can let you watch your favorite Netflix shows and movies synchronously with your friends, and Hulu has just built in a similar, native feature.
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition to only communicating with friends, many of the clubs that I was involved with at school are creating virtual meetings using Facebook and Zoom. They post meeting times, information, and Zoom links on Facebook, then we can still hold our meetings over Zoom.
    </p>
    <p>
    During this pandemic, we have also seen mass protests towards police violence against people of color. During this time, it is more important than ever to communicate with others, and communicate the need for reform. No matter whether it is through Zoom, ralleys, Facebook, or any other platform, it is imparative to stay connected to each other and to the world around us.
